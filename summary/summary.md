# High level items
* Service mesh all over the place
* Using certificates with a real tld
* Secret stores
* We have to use github or gitlab
* Prometheous
    * All over the place but not HA!!
    * Thanos is available, but takes some work

# Pragmatic Thoughts
_"Way back in March.."_

* Tools are changing rapidly.
* Expertise on moving targets.
* We will need team(s) to support migration and evolution of platform.
* Microsoft does not appear to be first class citizen in this realm.
